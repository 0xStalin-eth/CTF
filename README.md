## Tips
To make the most out of these challenges:
- Dive onto each Challenge **BEFORE** reading the Rules(Goals) of the CTF.
- First identify the vulnerability on the contracts, once you've uncovered the vulnerability, go to the rules of the CTF to know what is the actual goal of the CTF

By first diving into the contracts without knowing what is the goal you will allow yourself to focus on finding the vulnerability without trying to reverse engineer from the goal to the vulnerability.

Going through the CTF by following the recommendation you'll sharpen your audit and bug bounty skills because this way will help you to develop the attacker's mindset.
